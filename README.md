# Getting and Cleaning Data - Course Project

This is the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.
The R script, `run_analysis.R`, does the following:

1. Download the dataset 
2. Read data from the files into the variables
3. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
4. Merge columns to get the data frame Data for all data
5. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
6. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
7. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
8. Creates a second,independent tidy data set and ouput it
9. Creating codebook.Rmd file

The end result is shown in the file `tidy.txt`.
